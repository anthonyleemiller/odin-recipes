Mock recipe website for html practice

Purpose of this project is to fully utilize basic html/git skills to create and commit a mock website from beginning to end.

It all is coming together pretty easily, though I know it's not too difficult to make this king of project. It is cool to see it all come together and instantly seeing the results of all the work put into it from html boilerplate all the way to surfing through your linked pages.

Mixed absolute with relative links for pictures to practice both!
